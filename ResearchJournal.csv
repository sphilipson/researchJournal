leftDoubleImage,Solomia Kravats ,website,"Waarhol.com is easily one of my favourite website designs in this journal. A website dedicated to the life and works of Andy Warhol, Waarhol.com uses clever animations that do not allow the user to continue through the page without scrolling the mouse. The continuous scrolling aspect is fun and pleasing to the eye. I like the interaction aspect of the mouse icon, a circle that inverts whatever is behind it. This makes an informational website more interactive and interesting in such a fun way. The colour palette is bright and contrasting, going so far as to clash at times. As far as I can find, this website no longer exists and I can only access it using the wayback machine.",img/waaarhol1.png,img/waaarhol2.png,waarhol.com | Solomia Kravatz | website | 2020-2023,,https://waaarhol.com,, 
leftDoubleImage,Will Robinson,Website Designer,"Designer Will Robinson's collection, plunder and poach, follows the designer as he finds and remakes websites he enjoys, creating new brands to match, donuts.com is a perfect example of this collection, having its design based off findwunder.com. Similarly to Waarhol.com, donuts.com uses continuous scrolling to increase the interactivity of the page. The text and image placement feels almost random but is clearly deliberately placed, this adds a layer or unexpectedness to the page. The colour palette is strong and vibrant and reinforces a theme of amusement and joy that aligns with the pseudo-brand. The use of animation, continuous scroll and randomised object placement inspired my own website design.",img/donuts1.png,img/donuts2.png,donuts.com | will robinson,website | 2023,https://plunderandpoach.webflow.io,,
leftDoubleImage,Pierre-Louis Labonne,Website and Graphic Designer,"This delightfully interactive website is the portfolio of Pierre-Louis Labonne. Enchanting the user through the use of interactive animated buttons that press down when touched, a customisable Pierre Louis avatar, and a clickable, swipeable, control board displaying his information and portfolio. The design of the website is absolutely top tier, engaging user through its various interactivities and bouncy cartoon designs. This website design encourages play in the best way and I'd love to incorporate some of these elements in my designs.",img/pierre1.png,img/pierre2.png,Pierre-Louis Labonne,website | 2023,https://pierrelouis.webflow.io/#main-section,,

The mixture of text, colour and animation all together with the level of interactivity, using  keyboard, mouse click and mouse follow, was incredibly influential in my own experimentation with p5.",img/samanthaangsy1.png,img/samanthaangsy2.png,codewords | samantha ng,website | 2020,https://simandy.github.io/codewords/,,

Exploring their wide range of works really opened my eyes to the possibilities of p5 and creative coding possibilities on a whole.

She combines a stylised p5 visual on a computer with a physical ""pancake flipper"" that allows her to physically flip the animated pancake. The art design is considered, and the concept is original and fun. This inspires me to investigate arduino capabilities further, and possibly do something similar in my final project.",img/tamara1.png,,flip the pancake | tamara solis | arduino installation | 2023,arduino installation | 2024,https://www.behance.net/gallery/195225725/Flip-the-pancake-motion-controller-experiment,,
left,O Jungio ,interactive designer,"Using an arduino board and a sonicPi, Ojungio creates a voice box for his plant. The arduino is able to tell when the plant needs to be watered, using humidity and moisture sensors. If the levels are below critical levels, a music note is sent to sonicPi, at which point the plant will proceed to yell at its owner until the owner waters it. There are multiple sounds that play, rotating through so the owner does not get complacent. This arduino project is both useful and fun and has significantly influenced my idea for the final project.

The top image is from the retro arcade she created using a raspberry pi and human sized buttons and joysticks. The bottom is a  huge musical steps interactive game, in which players jump on each footprint, and each footprint makes different musical sounds, combining sound and game design in a fun interactive way.

Her proud parent robot is a brilliant intermingling of grief during the pandemic, and cheeky, clever design. Giertz creates a ""proud parent"" out of motors, lazer-cut wood and a 25c coin slot. When the coin is put in the slot, the ""parent's"" arm reaches down and pats her on the shoulder, saying ""I'm proud of you son"". Seeing the ""proud parent"" video completely changed my perspective and understanding of robotics and sparked my interest in something I'd never had experience in before.",img/simone.jpg,,proud parent | Simone Gietz | 2020,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1B3gATS0GE,,
left,boopablez | cat dispenser,Artist,"This cat dispenser is used by artist boopablez  at various conventions. It dispenses gatcha balls filled with stickers and other goodies to customers when the cat's nose is ""booped"". This interactive arduino design is such a fun concept, but the design of the cat itself turns a simple gatcha dispenser into a fun interactive activity for customers. I would love to implement a similar design concept in my final project as I think it really brings the project to life and adds more to the overall feel of the piece.",img/boopablez1.png,,cat dispenser | boopablez | 2023,,https://boopablez.square.site,,
